# TerrariaKaleidoscopeLagFix

This mod attempts to fix a bug that makes the Kaleidoscope whip unusuable in Terraria on ARM Based, or potentially all MacBooks. This mod is very early in development, and the issue needs to be tested on more computers. I had to slightly modify the behavior of the whip (removing the debuff, but buffing the tag damage) in order to get this to work - in later versions I plan to fix the debuff to not have to use this work-around. Please let me know if you discover any issues.
